# Face Recognition Based Attendance System (web app) using Flask and ML(Computer Vision)

Here comes the ultimate project of machine learning based web app [Full-Stack Website] which is Face Recognition Based Attendance system . 

This amazing ML(computer vision) based web app was created by me, as part of a hackathon conducted by our college .

Here's how this works :-

As it is a fresh run , there are 0 users in database.

Lets add a face/user.

The app is gonna capture 100 images of the student for adding it to the database.These images will be used by a KNN model for training purpose.

Now we can see that  the number of users in in our database has become 1.

Now lets add one more face from internet.

Now lets start taking attendance...

As we can see that user's name along with the 'student id' is being showed on the frame.

As soon as I close this window by hitting 'esc' key , the student's attendance will show up in the frame !!

And here it is ...

The student's attendance contains the name , id , and time at which the attendance was marked !!

Let's take another attendance,,,

And in the same way as the first , the second attendance will also appear !!

So in this way we can use this project to mark the attendance of the students easily .

And another great feature of this project is everyday individual excel files will be created which will contain the names , id and the attendance time of only those students which our ML algorithm detects through face detecetion , and of course these will be same as students which are present for attending the class . 

Hope you liked the project .
